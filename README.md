# NOTES

*  Since original folder (client-root) has had added/removed files, it would not start.
* With moving **SRC FOLDER** out of changed original folder in **CLIENT**, and w/ installed deps, app successfully deployed to **DevBrowser** so I can track changes
* Future code adding process **NEED to MAKE SURE to follow/match naming conventions w/ b/e**

*  **Future development suggestion** *(recommended by my tutor A. Osorio)*:

- Add 'Request Access' button to send email address for the new user to be added to DB? Template is added in accessReqmail folder, can be opened as regular html in browser to test. **Template html can be added to Home page. Would need to store credentials of HOST to DB with bcrypt so credentials are not compromised!**
- Recommended to use nodemailer https://nodemailer.com/about/
for main setup ... use youtube video to setup form in node if need/want https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30VeUWxZjS8

update: git sucks
